# questionapp
An API for a question answering based mobile game

# how to use
- Write "nodemon start" on terminal to execute the API.
- It starts at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ by default but you can change it in index.js
- At top of the index.js file, there's a connection string to MongoDB. Create an instance at mongodb then copy and paste your connection string

It's as simple as that! Have fun editing!
